MECHANICAL
 
 Main Arm:
  - Rack and Pinion setup for adjustable counterweight (potentially w/ servo)
  - Protection from rotors/props to prevent injury**
  - Lengthen main arm?
  - Ensure pressed fit for MM bearing
  - Hollow out arm for wiring harness?
 
 Main Base:
  - Integrate padding into arm to prevent bumping into base (or give arm more clearance)
  - Firmly fasten system to a surface (or use very heavy base)**

 Motor Mount (MM)
  - Perforate MM arms for better lift + reduced weight
  - Widen Holes for MPU050 sensor
  - Mounting setup for ESCs on MM arms

 Rotating Base:
  - Widen rotating base
  - Arduino / PCB mounting points
  - Increase height for better propeller ground clearance
 
 Other / Multiple Components
  - Need to figure out mechanical pitch damper (Offload to software?)
  - Mechincal locks for limiting DOF
  - Mounting place and equipment for battery (rotating base?)
  - Mechanical pitch leveling (for Gyro calibration)

**Safety features
  
SOFTWARE
 - Gyro Calibration
 - Derivative Control
 - Servo control of counterweight
 - Create serial interface for changing tuning variables w/o recompiling every time 

ELECTRICAL
 - Silicone/Flexible Wires
 - Better connectors for Arduino and sensors
 - Route wires / Wiring harness?
 - Control pinion w/ servo for precise electronic control of counterweight
 - PCB for Arduino and peripherals
 - Built-in power and USB ports in base for easy programming and recharge
 - Estimate expected current/power draw and tailor battery capacity to suit needs of 1 day of lab usage
